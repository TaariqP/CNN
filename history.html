                    <div class="text">
                        <p>The origins of Convolutional neural networks can be traced back to 1943, where Warren McCulloch, a neurophysiologist, and Walter Pitts, a Mathematician, hypothesised how neurons in the body might work. They wrote a paper on this,
                            and went on to use electronics to model a simple neural network according to the paper they wrote. Artificial Neural networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (Often abbreviated to CNNs) were heavily inspired by biological
                            processes, and it is this process of trying to imitate nature artificially that has had an incredible effect on many fields of Computer Science. The simple neural network modelled by McCulloch and Pitts was certainly not incredibly
                            complex, but was a paramount step in the development of Neural Networks and CNNs, as it introduced the notion and idea of producing computers that could act more like humans.<br></p>

                        </figure>
                        <figure><img class="figure-img" src="assets/img/Picture14.jpg">
                            <figcaption>Pitts</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>The 1950s brought significant changes to the world of Computing, with advances in technology allowing humans to do more with Computers than before. For the first time, it was possible to simulate an artificial neural network computationally,
                            which provided an advance from McCulloch and Pitts’ simple electronic model, and highlighted the relevance of Neural Networks in the world of Computing.&nbsp;<br></p>
                        <h2>Current Advancements</h2>
                        <p>In the modern world, where Computers are advancing faster than ever before, Neural Networks show a lot of potential. Neural Networks can be used in fields like data Classification, where a neural network can be trained to classify
                            data according to criteria learnt.&nbsp;<br></p>
                        <figure><img class="figure-img" src="assets/img/Picture15.jpg">
                            <figcaption>Activation Functions and Summations</figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <p>Furthermore, there is the potential for making predictions based on existing data, which could be massively useful in fields like Stock market investment. This can be achieved by training a neural network to produce expected output
                            from a given set of inputs, and then applying it to unseen/ new data.</p>
                        <p>When talking about CNNs, the topic of Image processing will always come up. CNNs can be ‘trained’ with training data, such as pictures of a certain real life entities, and as they are trained (which is achieved by altering values
                            of the weights that are fed into the neurons of the CNN), they can be expected to more accurately identify other entities of the original type. That being said, there are plenty of other fields in which CNNs can have a positive
                            effect. For example CNNs have applications in recommender systems, which are information filtering systems that can analyse user behaviour and are often used to recommend products or services to specific users based on their
                            behaviour on the internet, a feature which has proven itself invaluable to ecommerce and marketing over the years. In fact, CNNs can address needs in several fields where analogue data must be processed with minimal preprocessing,
                            such as natural language processing.&nbsp;<br></p>
                        <p>An example of a recent implementation of CNNs is in machine translation of pictures containing words or phrases in one language to another.<br></p>
                        <figure><img class="figure-img" src="assets/img/Picture17.jpg"></figure>
                        <p>&nbsp;This is done by CNNs via identifying pictures featuring words, and then identifying the actual words and phrases, allowing them to be converted to text for translation. This process emphasises the importance of the fact that
                            CNNs use little preprocessing, illustrated by how they can be implemented in brand new scenarios and provide almost instant results. Many similar applications have also been developed, where input like human handwriting can
                            be translated into computer text. We can see that CNNs can be used to address the needs of the many, providing utilities that make life easier for everyone, and not just Computational industrial processes.&nbsp;<br></p>
                        <figure><img class="figure-img" src="assets/img/Picture18.jpg"></figure>
                        <p>All the needs that can be addressed by neural networks and fields of Computing where they are implemented naturally make them a very attractive target for research and development. The idea that computers will be able to spot trends
                            in data that humans could never spot, and use this to produce valuable output, and ‘learn’ new behaviours without constant intervention from Computer Scientists is a promising vision. The ability to delegate mundane but necessary
                            tasks to Computers has always been a central idea when advancing the field of Computer Science, which makes the idea of Neural Networks and their applications in fields like Machine learning invaluable in emerging fields like
                            Big data, which is resulting in data too large in volume and fast in terms of collection rate to be possibly analysed by humans, never mind to discern useful trends in things like consumption and needs of people.&nbsp;<br></p>
